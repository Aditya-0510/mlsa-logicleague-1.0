You have been given multiple queries, each asking for the Fibonacci number at a specific position. Your task is to efficiently compute the Fibonacci number for the given position and return the result.

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

The Fibonacci of n is the sum of the fibonacci of its two preceding numbers.

Your goal is to implement a function that computes F(n) for each query.
