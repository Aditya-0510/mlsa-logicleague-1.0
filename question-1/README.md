You have encountered an army of N monsters, and you must defeat them all!

Each monster has a certain amount of health points (HP) that you know beforehand—the i-th monster has Hᵢ HP.

Rules:
You can attack exactly one monster per day.

You can only attack a monster if your attack stat (A) is greater than or equal to its HP (i.e., you must defeat it in a single hit).

At the end of each day, the HP of all alive monsters increases by a fixed amount X.

You are allowed to kill the monsters in any order.

Objective:
Find the minimum possible value of the attack stat A required to kill all the monsters.
